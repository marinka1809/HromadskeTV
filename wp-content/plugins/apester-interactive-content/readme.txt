**Why can’t I find the Red Apester Logo on my editor?**<br />
There are two reasons as to why you might not be seeing the Apester logo. Firstly, check you are not using the text editor when writing in your page, but that you have selected the [visual editor](https://en.support.wordpress.com/visual-editor/). If you can’t find the visual editor you might have it disabled. Head to your “Users” tab → “Your Profile” and uncheck the checkbox for disabling the visual editor when writing.
